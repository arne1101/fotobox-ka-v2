## Make my photobooth shine again
### 2018-05-02

I build a photobooth for my own weeding 4 years ago. It's still a great booth and works just fine. I use it 4-5 times per year on birthday parties, weddings, and so on. But the hardware needs to be refreshed and software also may worth some updates.

Thats why I've started this project: https://github.com/arne1101/fotobox-ka-v2/projects/1

Follow my journey to make my photobooth shine again.
