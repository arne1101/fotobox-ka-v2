## New Hardware up and running
### 2018-05-12

Some days ago my new 3b+ version of the pi finally arrived. I've set everything up and it is running now. I also moved to Dancer2 and I now use plackup as Webserver for my App.
I've also talked to some friends about feature they'd like to see in my booth and the outcome was: video. So I also orderes a v2 camera module :-) 

Next steps are to put the new screen into the housing and so adapt everything to the new screen dimensions.

Since my booth is quite booked during the next weeks, I'll not touch the running system and wait to replace the screen some weeks.

Cheers,
Arne

## The new screen has arrived
### 2018-05-04

My booth was build to use an iPad mini as screen. This works fine. But the iPad mini screen is quite small (7") and it is a first gen iPad mini and this starts to get old and slow. Safari freezes from time to time, which is anoying when using the booth. 

That's why I searched for an alternative and I decided to give the Waveshare 10.1 "raspberry pi" touchscreen lcd a try. Compared to a 10" iPad it is very cheap and thats why I'd like to try this one out. 

Since my software is a WebApp, I just need to use a browser in "kiosk-mode" instead of the iPad's Safari browser. Should work without any problems.

I also orderes a new raspberry pi 3b+ and SD card. This will arrive shortly, too.

## Make my photobooth shine again
### 2018-05-02

I build a photobooth for my own weeding 4 years ago. It's still a great booth and works just fine. I use it 4-5 times per year on birthday parties, weddings, and so on. But the hardware needs to be refreshed and software also may worth some updates.

Thats why I've started <a href="https://github.com/arne1101/fotobox-ka-v2/projects/1">this project</a>

Follow my journey to make my photobooth shine again.
