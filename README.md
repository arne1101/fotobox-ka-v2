## The new screen has arrived
### 2018-05-04

My booth was build to use an iPad mini as screen. This works fine. But the iPad mini screen is quite small (7") and it is a first gen iPad mini and this starts to get old and slow. Safari freezes from time to time, which is anoying when using the booth. 

That's why I searched for an alternative and I decided to give the Waveshare 10.1 "raspberry pi" touchscreen lcd a try. Compared to a 10" iPad it is very cheap and thats why I'd like to try this one out. 

Since my software is a WebApp, I just need to use a browser in "kiosk-mode" instead of the iPad's Safari browser. Should work without any problems.

I also orderes a new raspberry pi 3b+ and SD card. This will arrive shortly, too.

## Make my photobooth shine again
### 2018-05-02

I build a photobooth for my own weeding 4 years ago. It's still a great booth and works just fine. I use it 4-5 times per year on birthday parties, weddings, and so on. But the hardware needs to be refreshed and software also may worth some updates.

Thats why I've started <a href="https://github.com/arne1101/fotobox-ka-v2/projects/1">this project</a>

Follow my journey to make my photobooth shine again.
